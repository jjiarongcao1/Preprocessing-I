      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Jiarong Cao, also known as Alex J. Cao, I moved to the US 16 years ago from Hongkong, China. Currently in-rolled with Lambda School for Software Engineer Part-time bootcamp course. The reason for me heading to Lambda is because being a software engineer is challenging, and challenges improve oneself. Being able to code means that infinite learning, which I believe will improve myself to a better person, the greater power is the power of knowledge.</p>
